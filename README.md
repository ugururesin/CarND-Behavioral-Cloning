Overview

![](img/sample.gif)

This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, a convolutional neural network is trained to clone a driving behavior from a simulator.
The CNN architecture used here is referenced from NVIDIA's ***End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars paper***.   
**Reference:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf

This repository contains follwoing five files: 
* model.py (script to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (the document you are reading right now)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track for one full lap)


The Project
---
The goal is to create and to validate of a CNN model that clones a driving behavior from a simulator.  
Simulator allows to collect data in the format shown below:

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.
